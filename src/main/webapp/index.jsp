as follows:

-

The development of the ICT (Cloud) enterprise sector in Ireland (attracting new
investments from FDI, and stimulating/supporting the emergence of start.ups
providing technology solutions and services in the cloud space (these
investments may emerge from existing sectors).
-
-
Stimulating the take up and use of cloud computing by small businesses and
start ups in Ireland (cost reduction/productivity/efficiencies) across all sectors.
-
-
